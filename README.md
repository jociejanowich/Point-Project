This Java project implements a Point class to represent 2D points with x and y coordinates. The class provides methods to create, copy, compare, and manipulate points, including distance calculations, translation, and alignment checks.
Includes:
  -Constructors: Default (0,0) and parameterized.
  -Getters & Setters: Access and update coordinates with input validation.
  -Printing & String Representation: Display points as (x, y).
  -Copy & Equals: Copy points and check for equality.
  -Distance Calculations: Distance from origin or another point.
  -Translation: Shift points while enforcing non-negative coordinates.
  -Alignment Checks: Determine if points are horizontal or vertical relative to each other.
  -Interactive Demo: Accepts user input to demonstrate all methods.
  -Input Validation: Creates safe interative use
